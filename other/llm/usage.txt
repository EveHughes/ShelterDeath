ChatGPT

Generated by xinqiyue
To ensure that the months are displayed in order from January to December in your `ggplot2` graph, you need to convert the `month` column into a factor with levels set to the correct order. Here’s how you can modify your code:

```r
# Read the analysis data of shelter residence death
shelter_death_data <- read_csv("../data/analysis_data/shelter_residences_death_analysis_data.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

# Convert the 'month' column to a factor with levels in the correct order
shelter_death_data$month <- factor(shelter_death_data$month, levels = month.abb)

# Get line graph showing the annual death trend
ggplot(shelter_death_data, aes(x = month, y = total_decedents, group = year)) + 
  geom_line(size = 1, color = "black") +  # Get line graph
  geom_point(size = 2, color = "pink") +  # Add points on value in each year
  labs(title = "Total Deaths in Toronto Shelters (2007-2024)",
       x = "Month",
       y = "Total Deaths") +  # Add title and name of the axis
  theme_minimal() +    
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 12)
  ) + 
  facet_wrap(~ year, ncol = 3)
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Convert the month to a factor**: The `month` column is converted to a factor with levels specified as `month.abb`, which contains the abbreviations for the months in the correct order (Jan, Feb, ..., Dec).
  
2. **Using `facet_wrap`**: This will now correctly display the months in the proper sequence for each year.

With these adjustments, your graph should now display the months in chronological order.

I want to summarize the death toll dataset in a table. What else can it contain besides the average?

ChatGPT

Generated by xinqiyue
In addition to showing the average, you can summarize the shelter death data set in a table, adding the following statistics:

1. **Standard Deviation**: Shows the degree of fluctuation in the number of deaths each year.

2. **Median**: Indicates the middle value of the number of deaths, which better reflects the actual distribution of the data than the average, especially when the data has extreme values.

3. **Minimum**: The lowest number of deaths per year.

4. **Maximum**: The highest number of deaths per year.

5. **Quartiles**: Q1 (first quartile) and Q3 (third quartile) help to observe the distribution of the data.

6. **Total Deaths**: Calculate the total number of deaths over the entire time period.

7. **Gender Proportions**: Show the proportion of deaths by gender, such as the percentage of males, females, and other genders.

8. **Year Range**: Show the time range covered by the data set.
9. **Growth Rate**: Calculate the growth rate based on the number of deaths each year and analyze its changing trend.
10. **Outliers**: If there are abnormal years, such as when the number of deaths is significantly higher than other years, you can mark these abnormal data.

In this way, your table not only contains simple summary data, but also reflects the distribution and trend of the data, which helps readers better understand the overall changes in the deaths of shelter residents.

how to get nice tables in R that can be shown on a pdf

ChatGPT

Generated by xinqiyue
To generate aesthetically pleasing tables in R that can be displayed in a PDF, the best approach is to use the `kableExtra` package along with `knitr::kable`. This combination allows you to format tables in a visually appealing way and export them as part of a PDF.

Here's a step-by-step guide to creating beautiful tables in R for PDF:

### 1. Install and Load Required Packages
First, install the necessary packages if you haven't already:

```r
install.packages("kableExtra")
install.packages("knitr")
```

Then, load the packages:

```r
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
```

### 2. Create a Sample Table
Let's assume you have a dataset, for example `mtcars`, and want to summarize some statistics:

```r
# Sample summary table using mtcars dataset
summary_table <- mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_mpg = mean(mpg),
    avg_hp = mean(hp),
    avg_wt = mean(wt)
  )
```

### 3. Generate a Styled Table for PDF Output
You can use the `kable()` function with `kableExtra` for additional styling. Here's how you can format a table:

```r
# Generate a nicely formatted table
summary_table %>%
  kbl(caption = "Car Specifications by Cylinder Count",
      col.names = c("Cylinders", "Average MPG", "Average HP", "Average Weight")) %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = FALSE, html_font = "Cambria") %>%
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Specifications" = 3))
```

### 4. Render the Table in PDF via R Markdown or Quarto

If you're using R Markdown (`.Rmd`) or Quarto (`.qmd`), include the table creation code in a chunk and render it as a PDF. Here's an example of how to structure your R Markdown file:

```markdown
---
title: "Car Specifications Table"
output: pdf_document
---

```{r results='asis'}
summary_table %>%
  kbl(caption = "Car Specifications by Cylinder Count",
      col.names = c("Cylinders", "Average MPG", "Average HP", "Average Weight")) %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = FALSE, html_font = "Cambria") %>%
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Specifications" = 3))
```
```

### Additional Customization

- **Styling:** You can use other themes like `kable_styling()`, or more advanced features like `cell_spec()` for color or bold/italic text.
- **Conditional Formatting:** You can color rows, columns, or specific cells using functions like `row_spec()`, `column_spec()`, or `cell_spec()`.
- **Alignment and Borders:** Adjust alignment and borders for improved readability using `align`, `border`, and other arguments inside `kable()` or `kableExtra`.

### Example of Conditional Formatting
For advanced styling:

```r
summary_table %>%
  kbl(caption = "Car Specifications by Cylinder Count") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = FALSE) %>%
  column_spec(2, bold = TRUE, color = "blue") %>%
  row_spec(1, background = "#f7f7f7")
```

This method will create a table that looks great in PDF output and provides a clean and organized presentation.

  kable_classic(full_width = FALSE, html_font = "Cambria") %>%
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Deaths Summary" = 5, "Gender Ratios" = 3))
The table generated from the above is too wide and exceeds the page. How to make it smaller

ChatGPT

Generated by xinqiyue
To reduce the table size to avoid exceeding the page limits, you can use the `kable_styling` function with the `latex_options` parameter to set options like `scale_down`, and ensure that the font size of the table is appropriate. Additionally, you can set the column widths to make the table more compact. Here’s the modified code example:

```r
library(dplyr)
library(kableExtra)

summary_table <- shelter_death_data %>%
  filter(year >= 2007 & year <= 2023) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(
    total_deaths = sum(total_decedents),  # total death number
    mean_deaths = round(mean(total_decedents), 2),  # average death number each month, rounded to 2 decimal places
    median_deaths = round(median(total_decedents), 2),  # median, rounded
    min_deaths = min(total_decedents),  # minimum value
    max_deaths = max(total_decedents),  # maximum value
    male_ratio = round(sum(male) / total_deaths * 100, 2),  # ratio of male deaths, rounded
    female_ratio = round(sum(female) / total_deaths * 100, 2),  # ratio of female deaths, rounded
    other_ratio = round(sum(transgender_non_binary_two_spirit, na.rm = TRUE) / total_deaths * 100, 2)  # ratio of deaths of other genders, rounded
  )

summary_table %>%
  kbl(caption = "Annual Summary of Deaths in Toronto Shelters (2007-2023)",
      col.names = c("Year", "Total Deaths", "Mean", "Median", "Min", "Max", "Male Ratio (%)", "Female Ratio (%)", "Other Ratio (%)")) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "center", latex_options = "scale_down") %>%
  column_spec(1:9, border_right = TRUE) %>%
  add_header_above(c("Year" = 1, "Deaths Summary" = 5, "Gender Ratios" = 3)) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE)  # Make header bold for better visibility
```

### Explanation:
- **`latex_options = "scale_down"`**: This option will scale down the table to fit within the page size.
- **`column_spec(1:9, border_right = TRUE)`**: Adds a right border to all columns, which can be adjusted as needed.

After running this code, the table should shrink and fit within the PDF page. If it still exceeds the page limits, you might consider changing the font size or adjusting the column widths. You can further control the column widths using `column_spec` as necessary.

ChatGPT

Generated by xinqiyue
If your plot shows pink points but no black lines, it might be due to issues with the data, such as missing values, or the way the plot is constructed. Here are some possible reasons and solutions:

### 1. Check Data Integrity

Ensure that the `total_monthly_deaths` column in your `month_deaths` dataframe does not contain missing values or `NA`. You can check the values using:

```r
print(month_deaths)
```

Make sure each month has valid `total_monthly_deaths` data.

### 2. Ensure Correct Factor Order for Months

You correctly converted the `month` column into a factor and specified the order of months. Verify the factor levels to ensure they are in the correct order:

```r
month_deaths$month <- factor(month_deaths$month, levels = month.abb)
print(levels(month_deaths$month))  # Confirm factor levels
```

### 3. Use the `group` Parameter in `geom_line()`

If the grouping is not clear for `geom_line()`, it may not properly connect the points. You can explicitly add the `group` parameter to ensure the points are connected:

```r
ggplot(month_deaths, aes(x = month, y = total_monthly_deaths, group = 1)) +
  geom_line(size = 1, color = "black") +  # Draw lines
  geom_point(size = 3, color = "pink") +  # Add colored points
  labs(title = "Total Deaths in Toronto Shelters (2007-2023)",
       x = "Month",
       y = "Total Deaths") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 10)
  )
```

### 4. Check Data Type

Ensure that the `total_monthly_deaths` column is numeric, not a factor. If it is not numeric, convert it:

```r
month_deaths$total_monthly_deaths <- as.numeric(month_deaths$total_monthly_deaths)
```

### 5. Complete Example

Here's the complete example, incorporating the suggestions above:

```r
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Assuming you already have the shelter_death_data dataset
# Calculate the total deaths per month
month_deaths <- shelter_death_data %>%
  filter(year >= 2007 & year <= 2023) %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(total_monthly_deaths = sum(total_decedents, na.rm = TRUE))

# Ensure the month is a properly ordered factor
month_deaths$month <- factor(month_deaths$month, levels = month.abb)

# Ensure total_monthly_deaths is numeric
month_deaths$total_monthly_deaths <- as.numeric(month_deaths$total_monthly_deaths)

# Plot the line graph showing monthly death trends
ggplot(month_deaths, aes(x = month, y = total_monthly_deaths, group = 1)) +
  geom_line(size = 1, color = "black") +  # Draw line
  geom_point(size = 3, color = "pink") +  # Add pink points
  labs(title = "Total Deaths in Toronto Shelters (2007-2023)",
       x = "Month",
       y = "Total Deaths") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 10)
  )
```

### Summary

- **Check for missing or invalid data values**.
- **Verify that the factor levels for months are correctly ordered**.
- **Use the `group` parameter in `geom_line()` to ensure lines are drawn between points**.
- **Make sure the data type is numeric where needed**.

This should ensure that both black lines and pink points appear on your plot. Let me know if the issue persists, and I can help further troubleshoot.

I have a line chart that calculates the data from 2007 to 2023 grouped by month. For example, the number of deaths in January 2007 plus the number of deaths in January 2008 and the number of deaths in January 2023 are the data for January. This table was generated after calculating the data for 12 months. This chart is used to analyze whether there are more deaths in a certain month. Perhaps seasonal changes can be analyzed, such as high temperatures, low temperatures, and changes in mortality caused by catastrophic weather. Based on the current line chart alone, the conclusion is that more deaths occur in January and November, while the least deaths occur in March and September. But further investigation is needed since other factors like covid 19 could affecr the result
The above is what I want to express. Please help me write an example and give my line chart a name.

**Title: Monthly Mortality Trends Among Shelter Residents (2007-2023)**

The line chart displays the aggregated monthly death counts for shelter residents. This data was derived by summing the death counts for each January from 2007 through 2023, resulting in a comprehensive dataset for January, and repeating this process for each of the other months, thereby generating data for all twelve months.

The purpose of this visualization is to analyze whether certain months experience higher mortality rates. It opens the door to exploring potential seasonal influences on death rates, such as the impact of extreme temperatures or adverse weather conditions, which could contribute to increased mortality among shelter residents. 

Based on the current findings illustrated, it is evident that January and November show the highest death counts, while March and September exhibit the lowest mortality figures. These insights highlight the need for further investigation into the factors influencing these monthly variations, which could inform targeted interventions to improve the health and safety of shelter residents.

How to get 16 different graphs group by year

ChatGPT

Generated by xinqiyue
To better visualize the data, you can group the data by year and generate a separate chart for each year. You can do this in ggplot2 using the facet_wrap() function. This will group by year and generate a separate line chart for each year.

### Code example:

```r
shelter_death_data <- shelter_death_data %>%
  mutate(year_month = paste(year, month, sep = "-"))

ggplot(shelter_death_data, aes(x = month, y = total_decedents, group = year)) +
  geom_line(size = 1, color = "black") +
  geom_point(size = 1, color = "pink") +
  labs(title = "Total Deaths in Toronto Shelters (2007-2023)", 
       x = "Month", 
       y = "Total Deaths") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 10)
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~ year, ncol = 4)
```

### illustrate:
1. **`facet_wrap(~ year, ncol = 4)`**This will generate subplots by year, with 4 plots per row. You can adjust the value of `ncol` to control how many plots are displayed per row.
2. **`group = year`**：Make sure the data is grouped by year so that the data in each subplot is connected by a line for each month.

### Effect:
- Each year has a separate sub-graph showing the number of deaths in each month of that year.
- Use `facet_wrap()` to easily break the data into multiple small graphs, each corresponding to a year.

4.5.6 Results
Two excellent examples of results sections are provided by Kharecha and Hansen (2013) and Kiang et al. (2021). In the results section, we want to communicate the outcomes of the analysis in a clear way and without too much focus on the discussion of implications. The results section likely requires summary statistics, tables, and graphs. Each of those aspects should be cross-referenced and have text associated with them that details what is seen in each figure. This section should relay results; that is, we are interested in what the results are, rather than what they mean.

This section would also typically include tables of graphs of coefficient estimates based on the modeling. Various features of the estimates should be discussed, and differences between the models explained. It may be that different subsets of the data are considered separately. Again, all graphs and tables need to have text in plain language accompany them. A rough guide is that the amount of text should be at least equal to the amount of space taken up by the tables and graphs. For instance, if a full page is used to display a table of coefficient estimates, then that should be cross-referenced and accompanied by about a full page of text about that table.

4.5.7 Discussion
A discussion section may be the final section of a paper and would typically have four or five sub-sections.

The discussion section would typically begin with a sub-section that comprises a brief summary of what was done in the paper. This would be followed by two or three sub-sections that are devoted to the key things that we learn about the world from this paper. These sub-sections are the main opportunity to justify or detail the implications of the story being told in the paper. Typically, these sub-sections do not see newly introduced graphs or tables, but are instead focused on what we learn from those that were introduced in earlier sections. It may be that some of the results are discussed in relation to what others have found, and differences could be attempted to be reconciled here.

Following these sub-sections of what we learn about the world, we would typically have a sub-section focused on some of the weaknesses of what was done. This could concern aspects such as the data that were used, the approach, and the model. In the case of the model we are especially concerned with those aspects that might affect the findings. This can be especially difficult in the case of machine learning models and Smith et al. (2022) provide guidance for aspects to consider. And the final sub-section is typically a few paragraphs that specify what is left to learn, and how future work could proceed.

In general, we would expect this section to take at least 25 per cent of the total paper. This means that in an eight-page paper we would expect at least two pages of discussion.what should be included in discussion and result

### Results Section
The **Results** section presents the outcomes of your analysis in a clear, factual manner, without interpretation or implications. It should include:

1. **Summary Statistics**: Present the descriptive statistics (e.g., means, medians, counts) of key variables like total deaths, gender breakdown, and year-on-year variation. Use tables to clearly display these figures.

2. **Tables and Graphs**: Include visual representations of your findings. For example:
   - A table showing the total number of deaths per year.
   - A graph displaying the trend of deaths over time, categorized by gender.
   - A comparison of monthly death counts, highlighting peak and low periods.
   Each table and graph should be referenced in the text, explaining what is visually represented without discussing its implications. For example, "Figure 2 shows the increasing trend of deaths from 2007 to 2024, with a peak in 2021."

3. **Model Results**: If models are used, display coefficient estimates and other relevant statistics in a table. Mention the important features of these estimates (e.g., significance, confidence intervals), and explain any differences between models (e.g., how a different subset of the data impacts the results). Ensure there is enough plain-language text accompanying these outputs to describe them thoroughly.

The Results section focuses on **what the data shows**, not on what it means. For example, you might state that the number of deaths has risen over the years, but not **why** this increase might have happened. Avoid interpretation, which is reserved for the Discussion section.

---

### Discussion Section
The **Discussion** section delves into the implications of your findings. It generally includes the following sub-sections:

1. **Summary of Key Findings**: Start with a brief recap of what was done in the paper and summarize the main results. For example, “This paper analyzed mortality trends in Toronto’s shelter system from 2007 to 2024, highlighting a significant increase in deaths and gender disparities.”

2. **Interpretation of Findings**: Discuss the key implications of the results:
   - Why has there been an increase in the number of deaths over time?
   - What could explain the gender disparity in deaths (e.g., a larger proportion of men in shelters)?
   - Are there seasonal patterns or other temporal trends?
   
   Here, you can relate your findings to previous studies or data sources to support your claims. Explore possible causes like economic factors, public health crises (like COVID-19), or shelter conditions.

3. **Comparison to Previous Research**: Compare your results to other studies on homelessness and mortality. Discuss differences or similarities, and propose reasons for these, such as varying datasets, geographic contexts, or timeframes.

4. **Limitations of the Study**: Discuss any weaknesses in your approach, data, or model. For example:
   - The dataset lacks specific demographic variables like age or health conditions, which could affect the accuracy of mortality analyses.
   - Gender data for non-binary individuals only became available after 2020, limiting a full understanding of gender differences over time.
   - The model might not account for unobserved factors affecting mortality rates, such as policy changes or extreme weather events.

5. **Future Research**: Finally, outline what is left to explore and how future research could build on your findings. For example, more detailed demographic data could allow for a finer analysis of mortality rates by age or health status, or a focus on causes of death could provide deeper insights into the risk factors faced by shelter residents.

---

### Summary
- **Results Section**: Factual presentation of the data with accompanying tables and graphs.
- **Discussion Section**: Interpretation of the results, comparison with other studies, acknowledgment of limitations, and suggestions for future research. It often accounts for 25% of the paper’s length.

I want to test that each month is correct (jan-dec)

ChatGPT

Generated by xinqiyue
To test whether the generated months all fall into the correct range (from "Jan" to "Dec"), you can extract the generated months and check whether they all fit in this range. Here is the code to test whether each month is correct:

```r
# Generate a date sequence
dates <- seq.Date(
from = as.Date("2007-01-01"),
to = as.Date("2024-08-01"),
by = "month"
)
# Extract the English abbreviation of the month
months <- format(dates, "%b")

# Check if all months are in the range of "Jan" to "Dec"
valid_months <- c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec")
all_correct <- all(months %in% valid_months)

# Output the result
if (all_correct) {
print("All months are in the correct range")
} else {
print("There is an incorrect month")
}
```

### Explanation
1. **`format(dates, "%b")`**: Extract the English abbreviation of the month in the date.
2. **`valid_months`**: Defines the correct range of months, from "Jan" to "Dec".
3. **`all(months %in% valid_months)`**: Checks whether each month in `months` belongs to `valid_months` and returns a Boolean value.
4. **`if (all_correct)`**: Outputs a message based on the check result to tell you whether all months are correct.

If all months are in the range of "Jan" to "Dec", the program will output "All months are in the correct range"; otherwise, it will output "There is an incorrect month".

I studied a dataset related to deaths in Toronto shelters and visualized the data. The following conclusions were drawn: the number of deaths increased year by year, and a larger proportion of deaths were among men.
Limitations of the data set are as follows. For reasons of client privacy and respect for confidentiality, even in death, we are not able to provide names, dates of birth, place of death, or any other information that might identify the deceased. We can present this data in aggregate form only. Average age of death is not provided in instances where only one decedent is represented in the data. The introduction is self-contained and tells a reader everything they need to know including: 1) broader context to motivate; 2) some detail about what the paper is about; 3) a clear gap that needs to be filled; 4) what was done; 5) what was found; 6) why it is important; 7) the structure of the paper. A reader should be able to read only the introduction and know what was done, why, and what was found. Likely 3 or 4 paragraphs, or 10 per cent of total. Write an intro for me

### Introduction

The rising number of deaths within Toronto’s shelter system is a growing concern, reflecting broader societal challenges such as homelessness, mental health crises, and inadequate access to healthcare. Understanding the dynamics of these deaths is crucial for developing effective policies and interventions aimed at reducing mortality within this vulnerable population. This paper focuses on analyzing a dataset related to deaths in Toronto shelters, providing insights into the demographic trends and factors contributing to these unfortunate outcomes.

Despite the importance of this issue, there is a clear gap in the detailed public understanding of who is affected and how patterns of mortality are evolving over time. Due to privacy concerns, the dataset is limited in scope, lacking identifying information such as names, dates of birth, and specific causes of death. Nevertheless, this aggregate data allows for an examination of key trends, such as the gender distribution of deaths and their year-by-year progression. These trends highlight critical disparities, particularly the higher proportion of male deaths and the steady increase in overall mortality rates.

This study aims to fill the gap by providing a visual and statistical analysis of the available data, drawing attention to the factors that may be contributing to the increased mortality. The analysis reveals two important findings: first, the number of deaths has steadily increased over the years, indicating a worsening situation within the shelter system; second, men make up a larger proportion of the deceased, suggesting potential gender-specific vulnerabilities.

These findings are important because they offer a clearer picture of the scope and nature of mortality in Toronto shelters, which can inform future policy decisions and resource allocation. By identifying key trends and limitations within the dataset, this study provides a foundation for more targeted and informed interventions aimed at addressing the underlying causes of death in this population. The structure of this paper proceeds with a detailed description of the data, followed by the methodology, results, and discussion of the implications.

ChatGPT

Generated by xinqiyue
To change the color of the bar chart to a pink and black theme and solve the problem of the years on the horizontal axis being squeezed together, you can adjust it in the following ways:

1. **Custom color**: You can choose a suitable color fill, such as black and pink.
2. **Adjust the display of the horizontal axis**: Use `scale_x_discrete()` to better control the display of the horizontal axis label.

Here is the modified code:

```r
# Create a bar chart showing the annual number of deaths in Toronto shelters from 2007 to 2023
ggplot(annual_death_counts, aes(x = factor(year), y = count, fill = gender)) +
geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "stack") +
labs(title = "Annual Death Counts in Toronto Shelters (2007-2023)",
x = "Year",
y = "Number of Deaths",
fill = "Gender") +
scale_fill_manual(values ​​= c("male_deaths" = "pink", "female_deaths" = "black", "other_deaths" = "gray")) + # Custom colors
theme_minimal() +
theme(
plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, face = "bold"),
axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
axis.text = element_text(size = 10),
axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1) # Rotate the horizontal axis labels to avoid overlap
)
```

### Key changes:

1. **`scale_fill_manual()`**: Here you can customize the color of each gender, `"pink"` for male, `"black"` for female, and `"gray"` for other genders. You can change these color values ​​as needed.

2. **`axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)`**: Rotate the text of the horizontal axis 45 degrees, which can effectively avoid overlapping of the year labels and make them easier to read.

After using the above code, your bar chart should have a pink and black theme, and the year labels will be clearer and easier to read.

I don't want the names of the colors on the side, like male_deaths, to be underlined

ChatGPT

Generated by xinqiyue
To remove the underline in the legend and not show the corresponding color name at the bottom (e.g. `male_deaths`), you can set `labels` in `scale_fill_manual()` to the labels you wish to show, or remove the legend entirely. Here is a code example of how to do both:

### If you want to hide the legend:
```r
# Create a bar chart showing the annual number of deaths in Toronto shelters from 2007 to 2023
ggplot(annual_death_counts, aes(x = factor(year), y = count, fill = gender)) +
geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "stack") +
labs(title = "Annual Death Counts in Toronto Shelters (2007-2023)",
x = "Year",
y = "Number of Deaths") +
scale_fill_manual(values ​​= c("male_deaths" = "pink", "female_deaths" = "black", "other_deaths" = "gray")) + # Custom colors
theme_minimal() +
theme(
plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, face = "bold"),
axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
axis.text = element_text(size = 10),
axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1), # Rotate the horizontal axis labels to avoid overlap
legend.position = "none" # Hide the legend
)
```

### If you want to keep the legend but remove the underline:
You can use the `labels` parameter to specify the names you want to appear in the legend. For example:

```r
# Create a bar chart showing the annual number of deaths in Toronto shelters from 2007 to 2023
ggplot(annual_death_counts, aes(x = factor(year), y = count, fill = gender)) +
geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "stack") +
labs(title = "Annual Death Counts in Toronto Shelters (2007-2023)",
x = "Year",
y = "Number of Deaths") +
scale_fill_manual(values ​​= c("male_deaths" = "pink", "female_deaths" = "black", "other_deaths" = "gray"),
labels = c("Male", "Female", "Other")) + # Custom labels
theme_minimal() +
theme(
plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, face = "bold"),
axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
axis.text = element_text(size = 10),
axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1) # Rotate horizontal axis labels to avoid overlap
)
```

In the above code, the `labels` parameter replaces `male_deaths`, `female_deaths`, and `other_deaths` with simpler labels such as "Male", "Female", and "Other", and removes the underscores.

What is the difference between @misc and @mannual
ChatGPT

Generated by xinqiyue
In BibTeX, `@misc` and `@manual` are both entry types used for citing non-standard sources, but they serve different purposes and convey different meanings:

### `@misc`
- **Purpose**: This entry type is used for citing miscellaneous references that do not fit into standard categories like articles, books, or reports. It is quite flexible and can include a wide range of materials such as web pages, personal communications, or informal publications.
- **Typical Usage**: You would use `@misc` for anything that doesn’t have a specific type like articles, books, etc. For example, web pages, presentations, or informal reports.
- **Example**:
  ```bibtex
  @misc{example,
    author = {John Doe},
    title = {An Interesting Article},
    year = {2024},
    url = {http://example.com},
    note = {Accessed: 2024-09-24}
  }
  ```

### `@manual`
- **Purpose**: This entry type is specifically designed for citing technical manuals or documentation related to software, systems, or other technical materials.
- **Typical Usage**: Use `@manual` when you want to reference a user manual or technical documentation that provides instructions or guidance on using a particular product or service.
- **Example**:
  ```bibtex
  @manual{example_software,
    title = {User Manual for Example Software},
    author = {Jane Smith},
    organization = {Example Organization},
    year = {2024},
    address = {City, Country},
    note = {Available at: http://example.org/manual}
  }
  ```

### Summary
- **Use `@misc`** for general or miscellaneous references that don’t fit other categories.
- **Use `@manual`** specifically for citing technical manuals or documentation.

Choosing the correct entry type helps in accurately representing the source you are citing and ensures proper formatting in your bibliography.

# Introduction

The rising number of deaths within Toronto's shelter system is a growing area of concern, reflecting broader societal challenges such as homelessness, mental health crises, and inadequate access to health care. Understanding the dynamics of these deaths is critical to developing effective policies and interventions aimed at reducing mortality in this vulnerable population. This paper focuses on analyzing the dataset related to deaths in Toronto's shelter residence, and seeks to identify the demographic trends and factors contributing to these unfortunate outcomes.

Despite the importance of this issue, there is a clear gap in the public's detailed understanding of who is being affected and how patterns of mortality are evolving over time. Due to privacy concerns, the dataset is limited in scope and lacks identifying information such as names, dates of birth, and specific causes of death. Also, the Non-binary genders are not included until 2020. Nevertheless, these aggregate data allow for an examination of key trends, such as the gender distribution of deaths and the change over time. These trends highlight critical disparities, particularly the higher proportion of male deaths and the steady increase in overall mortality number.

This study aims to provide a visual and statistical analysis of the available data and to draw attention to the factors that may be contributing to the increased mortality. The analysis reveals two important findings: first, the number of deaths has steadily increased over the years, indicating a deteriorating situation within the shelter system; Second, men make up a larger proportion of the deceased, suggesting potential gender-specific vulnerabilities.

These findings are important because they provide a clearer picture of the extent and nature of mortality in Toronto's shelter population, which can be used to inform future policy decisions and the allocation of resources. By identifying key trends and limitations within the dataset, this study provides a basis for more targeted and informed interventions to address the underlying causes of death in this population. This paper begins with a comprehensive overview of the dataset, including its variables (@sec-var), limitations (@sec-lim), the rationale for its selection (@sec-sim), and the data collection process (@sec-measurement). Following this, the data is presented with accompanying graphs and analysis (@sec-overview). The subsequent section outlines key findings (@sec-result), followed by a discussion of their broader implications (@sec-discussion). All visualizations were generated using @citeR, with the data sourced from the @toronto_shelter_deaths dataset.


# Data {#sec-data}
The dataset used for this analysis relates to deaths within Toronto's shelter system, from @toronto_shelter_deaths. It contains key demographic variables and aggregates information about the number of deaths reported each year, categorized by gender. However, due to privacy concerns and respect for the confidentiality of individuals who have passed, the dataset excludes personal identifying information including names, birthdates, or specific locations of death. This limitation necessitated the use of data for analysis focusing on factors including gender distribution and time rather than locations and age. 

## Variables {#sec-var}
The dataset include the following variables:

1. **Year**: The year in which the death occurred at a Toronto shelter, ranging from 2007 to 2024. This variable aids in analyzing trends over time.

2. **Month**: The month in which the death occurred, corresponding to each year from January to December. Data beyond August 2024 has not yet been recorded.

3. **Total Deaths**: The total number of deaths recorded in the given month.

4. **Male Deaths**: The total number of male shelter residents who died in the given month.

5. **Female Deaths**: The total number of female shelter residents who died in the given month.

6. **Other Deaths**: The number of deaths of individuals identified as Transgender, Non-binary, or Two-Spirit in the given month. Note that data for this category was not recorded prior to 2020.

The variable follows the rule:
Total Death = Male Deaths + Female Deaths + Other Deaths

## Limitation {#sec-lim}
The dataset used for this analysis presents several limitations that must be acknowledged to provide a comprehensive understanding of the findings.

**Privacy and Respect for the Deceased**: Due to ethical considerations, certain sensitive information such as age and location of death was not collected. This lack of data may limit the ability to perform more granular analyses related to demographic factors influencing mortality rates among shelter residents.

**Gender Data Constraints**: Information on gender identity, specifically regarding transgender, non-binary, and two-spirit individuals, was not systematically recorded until 2020. As a result, prior to this year, any data related to these gender identities is missing. This gap restricts the ability to fully analyze trends and disparities in mortality rates among diverse gender identities over time.

**Absence of Comparable Datasets**: It is essential to consider that the dataset could be enriched by including broader contextual variables. Specifically, information about the total shelter population and its gender composition, age distribution, and health status of residents would provide a more nuanced understanding of the factors contributing to mortality in these settings. Such data would allow for deeper insights into the demographic profiles of those affected and could better inform policies aimed at addressing the challenges of homelessness and shelter living.

**Data Quality and Cleaning**: The dataset required careful cleaning to address issues such as missing values and inconsistencies, particularly in the reporting of deaths by gender. Although high-level cleaning was conducted to ensure the reliability of the data, the absence of certain variables may still introduce biases or limit the interpretability of the results.


By recognizing these limitations, the analysis aims to provide a clearer context for the findings and to encourage further research that can fill these gaps and enhance understanding of mortality trends among shelter residents.


## Similar Datasets {#sec-sim}
The dataset titled Deaths of People Experiencing Homelessness, from @toronto_homelessness_deaths, provides information on the deaths of homeless individuals, which is somewhat similar to our current study of deaths among Toronto shelter residents. One notable advantage of this dataset is that it includes a detailed CSV file outlining the causes of death, offering valuable insights into the factors contributing to mortality in this population.

However, the dataset containing the causes of death cannot be downloaded directly, which limits the accessibility and availability of our analysis. The accessible data variables align perfectly with our research dataset but only cover the period from 2017 to 2023. The lack of longitudinal data means it does not align with the comprehensive timeline of our study, which spans from January 2007 to August 2024. Therefore, although this dataset provides certain advantages, the limitations regarding its time span and accessibility led to its exclusion from our viable research options.

## Measurement {#sec-measurement}
Within this data set, the Structured Reporting System facilitates the collection of information regarding the death of shelter residents. Shelter operators are required to notify the City of Toronto within 24 hours of the death of a current or recent shelter resident and then submit a detailed written report within 30 days. This systematic approach, in place since 2007 and reviewed annually by Toronto Housing and Support Services, ensures timely and consistent data collection. The structured reporting requirement imposes a level of discipline on shelter operators to ensure that deaths are not only reported in a timely manner, but also fully documented, thereby enhancing the integrity and credibility of the dataset.

 However, certain limitations affect the completeness and reliability of the data. For example, due to privacy concerns, personal information such as names, dates of birth, and specific places of death are not collected. This limits the granularity of the data and can hinder deeper analysis, such as correlations with demographic or location-specific factors. In addition, shelter operators often do not have access to death certificates or information on causes of death, so the dataset lacks this critical context that could be important for understanding the factors contributing to mortality among shelter residents.

Improvements to the measurement process could include better integration with public health and legal entities to access more detailed information about deaths, including cause of death, while still protecting individual privacy. This improvement would provide a more holistic view of the factors influencing mortality rates among shelter residents, allowing for more informed policy decisions to address health and safety issues in shelters.


## Overall Visualization {#sec-overview}
In the following section, I will present a series of visualizations that analyze the number of deaths among shelter residents over time, highlighting the gender distribution and overall data trends. These charts will provide a clearer understanding of the data composition and allow for an insightful examination of how the number of deaths in this population has evolved.

### Trend Over Time

Figure @fig-shelter-death-line, created by @citeR, shows the total number of deaths of Toronto shelter residents each year from January 2007 to August 2024, divided into 15 sub-graphs, arranged in 5 rows and 3 columns by year. This layout allows readers to clearly compare the trend of deaths from one year to the next and observe potential seasonal changes.
Based on the generated line graphs, the following conclusions can be drawn:

1. **Overall Increasing Trend in Deaths**: From 2007 to 2024, there has been a consistent increase in the number of deaths. This trend may be related to several factors, including changes in economic conditions, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and overall population growth. These factors could contribute to a rise in the homeless population, leading to an increase in mortality rates.

2. **Peak Deaths in October 2021**: Notably, October 2021 recorded the highest number of deaths. This peak may be associated with the public health crisis stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, social isolation policies, and their effects on mental health and living conditions. Further research could help clarify the specific contributing factors during this period.

3. **Lack of Significant Seasonal Impact on Deaths**: Overall, there appears to be no substantial seasonal variation in death rates, indicating that the fluctuations in mortality may be more closely linked to economic and social factors rather than seasonal influences. 

These conclusions provide important insights into the overall mortality trends of Toronto shelter residents and suggest that relevant agencies need to consider multiple influencing factors when developing policies and interventions.


### Annual Deaths with Gender Composition
Figure @fig-annual-death, created by @citeR, below illustrates the annual number of deaths from 2007 to 2023. And Figure @fig-shelter-death-bar, created by @citeR, illustrates the annual number of deaths of the same time period, with distinct color coding to represent gender distribution: pink for male, black for female, and gray for other gender identities, including transgender and non-binary.

Several important conclusions can be drawn from the visualization. First, the proportion of male deaths remains consistently the highest throughout the years observed, indicating a significant gender disparity in mortality rates among shelter residents. In addition, there is a noticeable upward trend in the overall number of deaths, suggesting a growing concern for the well-being of this vulnerable population. It can also be seen clearly from the line graph of Figure @fig-annual-death. Notably, 2021 stands out as the peak year for mortality. This can be seen clearly in Figure @fig-annual-death too. This raises questions about the factors contributing to this spike and the broader implications for public health and social support systems.

### Compariasion Over Month
Figure @fig-monthly-death shows the aggregated monthly death counts for shelter residents from 2007 to 2023. This data was derived by summing the death counts for each January from 2007 to 2023, resulting in a comprehensive data set for January, and repeating this process for each of the other months, resulting in data for all twelve months.

The purpose of this visualization is to analyze whether certain months have higher mortality rates. It opens the door to exploring potential seasonal influences on mortality rates, such as the impact of extreme temperatures or adverse weather conditions, which could contribute to increased mortality among shelter residents.

The current findings, shown in the line graph, indicate that January and November have the highest mortality rates, while March and September have the lowest mortality rates. These findings highlight the need for further research into the factors influencing these monthly variations, which could inform targeted interventions to improve the health and safety of shelter residents.

# Results{#sec-result}
As time progresses, it is evident from Figures @fig-shelter-death-bar and @fig-annual-death that the number of deaths among shelter residents has increased. Potential reasons for this trend may include changes in the economic landscape, shifts in the overall population, policy modifications, and factors related to the pandemic.

Regarding monthly variations, while Figure @fig-monthly-death illustrates a noticeable peak in January and a low in September, a comprehensive view of the data in Figure @fig-shelter-death-line suggests that seasonal changes do not appear to have a significant correlation with the number of deaths. One possible explanation for this phenomenon could be related to the timing of the pandemic's outbreak.

In terms of gender composition, male deaths have consistently constituted the highest proportion from 2007 to 2023, indicating a potential underlying vulnerability. However, this trend may also be influenced by the higher proportion of males residing in shelters.

This article examines trends in mortality among shelter residents in Toronto from 2007 to 2023, with a focus on gender distribution. Our analysis shows that there was an upward trend in deaths during this period, with a higher proportion of men dying.
## Weaknesses and next steps

In exploring the implications of these findings, we gain valuable insights into the complex interplay of economic, social, and health factors that affect shelter residents. The data suggest that economic downturns, policy changes, and global health events may exacerbate the vulnerability of this population, warranting a reassessment of current support systems and interventions. In addition, the lack of a clear seasonal pattern in mortality suggests that other factors, such as the pandemic, may be masking typical seasonal effects and warrant further investigation.

While the results highlight important issues, certain limitations must be acknowledged. The dataset used for this analysis may not fully capture the demographics of the shelter population, such as sex composition and health status. In addition, the analysis relied on reported deaths, which may be inaccurate or underreported. Future research should aim to incorporate more comprehensive demographic data, such as data on the total shelter population and its gender composition, causes of death, etc., to improve our understanding of the factors driving these trends.

Finally, this study highlights several areas for future research. Further research could focus on the specific causes of mortality among shelter residents and the effectiveness of current policies and programs designed to reduce mortality among this vulnerable population. By addressing these gaps, we can better inform policy decisions and improve outcomes for people experiencing homelessness.

## Overview

This project explores the growing concern of mortality among residents of Toronto’s shelter system, with an emphasis on identifying trends and disparities in deaths between 2007 and 2024. Using open-source data from the City of Toronto, the study seeks to shed light on the demographics and seasonal variations that may contribute to these unfortunate outcomes. The dataset includes key variables such as year, month, gender distribution, and total death counts.

The analysis reveals that the number of deaths has steadily increased over the years, with a significant gender disparity: male deaths consistently account for the majority of fatalities. Additionally, the analysis of seasonal trends shows that mortality peaks in the colder months of January and November, though no consistent seasonal pattern is detected across the entire timeline. This suggests that other factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and social policy shifts, may have a larger influence on mortality rates.

The project employs various statistical and visualization techniques to illustrate these trends. The findings underline the importance of addressing gender-specific vulnerabilities and the critical need for public health interventions to reduce mortality rates in shelters. The analysis also highlights limitations in the dataset, including the lack of data on the overall shelter population's demographics and health status, as well as gaps in gender identity information prior to 2020. 

This repository contains:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning scripts.
- Exploratory data analysis and statistical summaries.
- Visualizations and insights into the mortality trends.
- Recommendations for policy changes based on the results.

By providing insights into these patterns, the project aims to inform future interventions and policies aimed at improving the living conditions and health outcomes of people residing in shelters.
