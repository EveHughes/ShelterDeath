To ensure that the months are displayed in order from January to December in your `ggplot2` graph, you need to convert the `month` column into a factor with levels set to the correct order. Here’s how you can modify your code:

```r
# Read the analysis data of shelter residence death
shelter_death_data <- read_csv("../data/analysis_data/shelter_residences_death_analysis_data.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

# Convert the 'month' column to a factor with levels in the correct order
shelter_death_data$month <- factor(shelter_death_data$month, levels = month.abb)

# Get line graph showing the annual death trend
ggplot(shelter_death_data, aes(x = month, y = total_decedents, group = year)) + 
  geom_line(size = 1, color = "black") +  # Get line graph
  geom_point(size = 2, color = "pink") +  # Add points on value in each year
  labs(title = "Total Deaths in Toronto Shelters (2007-2024)",
       x = "Month",
       y = "Total Deaths") +  # Add title and name of the axis
  theme_minimal() +    
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 12)
  ) + 
  facet_wrap(~ year, ncol = 3)
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Convert the month to a factor**: The `month` column is converted to a factor with levels specified as `month.abb`, which contains the abbreviations for the months in the correct order (Jan, Feb, ..., Dec).
  
2. **Using `facet_wrap`**: This will now correctly display the months in the proper sequence for each year.

With these adjustments, your graph should now display the months in chronological order.

help me check if there is any grammar mistakes in the following context. If so, fix it and make it more structured.
In exploring the implications of these findings, we gain valuable insights into the complex interactions of economic, social, and health-related factors that impact shelter residents. . Additionally, the lack of a clear seasonal pattern in mortality highlights that other factors, such as the pandemic, may mask typical seasonal effects and warrant further investigation.

While the results shed light on key issues, certain limitations must be acknowledged. The dataset used for this analysis may not fully capture the demographics of shelter residents, such as sex composition and health status. Additionally, the analysis relied on reported deaths, which may be inaccurate or underreported. Future research should aim to incorporate more comprehensive demographic data, such as data on the total shelter population and its sex composition, causes of death, etc., to enhance our understanding of the factors that drive these trends.

Finally, this study highlights several areas for future exploration. Further research could focus on the specific causes of death among shelter residents and the effectiveness of current policies and programs designed to reduce mortality among this vulnerable population. By addressing these gaps, we can better inform policy decisions and improve outcomes for people experiencing homelessness.

I want to summarize the death toll dataset in a table. What else can it contain besides the average?

ChatGPT

Generated by xinqiyue
In addition to showing the average, you can summarize the shelter death data set in a table, adding the following statistics:

1. **Standard Deviation**: Shows the degree of fluctuation in the number of deaths each year.

2. **Median**: Indicates the middle value of the number of deaths, which better reflects the actual distribution of the data than the average, especially when the data has extreme values.

3. **Minimum**: The lowest number of deaths per year.

4. **Maximum**: The highest number of deaths per year.

5. **Quartiles**: Q1 (first quartile) and Q3 (third quartile) help to observe the distribution of the data.

6. **Total Deaths**: Calculate the total number of deaths over the entire time period.

7. **Gender Proportions**: Show the proportion of deaths by gender, such as the percentage of males, females, and other genders.

8. **Year Range**: Show the time range covered by the data set.
9. **Growth Rate**: Calculate the growth rate based on the number of deaths each year and analyze its changing trend.
10. **Outliers**: If there are abnormal years, such as when the number of deaths is significantly higher than other years, you can mark these abnormal data.

In this way, your table not only contains simple summary data, but also reflects the distribution and trend of the data, which helps readers better understand the overall changes in the deaths of shelter residents.

how to get nice tables in R that can be shown on a pdf

ChatGPT

Generated by xinqiyue
To generate aesthetically pleasing tables in R that can be displayed in a PDF, the best approach is to use the `kableExtra` package along with `knitr::kable`. This combination allows you to format tables in a visually appealing way and export them as part of a PDF.

Here's a step-by-step guide to creating beautiful tables in R for PDF:

### 1. Install and Load Required Packages
First, install the necessary packages if you haven't already:

```r
install.packages("kableExtra")
install.packages("knitr")
```

Then, load the packages:

```r
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
```

### 2. Create a Sample Table
Let's assume you have a dataset, for example `mtcars`, and want to summarize some statistics:

```r
# Sample summary table using mtcars dataset
summary_table <- mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_mpg = mean(mpg),
    avg_hp = mean(hp),
    avg_wt = mean(wt)
  )
```

### 3. Generate a Styled Table for PDF Output
You can use the `kable()` function with `kableExtra` for additional styling. Here's how you can format a table:

```r
# Generate a nicely formatted table
summary_table %>%
  kbl(caption = "Car Specifications by Cylinder Count",
      col.names = c("Cylinders", "Average MPG", "Average HP", "Average Weight")) %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = FALSE, html_font = "Cambria") %>%
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Specifications" = 3))
```

### 4. Render the Table in PDF via R Markdown or Quarto

If you're using R Markdown (`.Rmd`) or Quarto (`.qmd`), include the table creation code in a chunk and render it as a PDF. Here's an example of how to structure your R Markdown file:

```markdown
---
title: "Car Specifications Table"
output: pdf_document
---

```{r results='asis'}
summary_table %>%
  kbl(caption = "Car Specifications by Cylinder Count",
      col.names = c("Cylinders", "Average MPG", "Average HP", "Average Weight")) %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = FALSE, html_font = "Cambria") %>%
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Specifications" = 3))
```
```

### Additional Customization

- **Styling:** You can use other themes like `kable_styling()`, or more advanced features like `cell_spec()` for color or bold/italic text.
- **Conditional Formatting:** You can color rows, columns, or specific cells using functions like `row_spec()`, `column_spec()`, or `cell_spec()`.
- **Alignment and Borders:** Adjust alignment and borders for improved readability using `align`, `border`, and other arguments inside `kable()` or `kableExtra`.

### Example of Conditional Formatting
For advanced styling:

```r
summary_table %>%
  kbl(caption = "Car Specifications by Cylinder Count") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = FALSE) %>%
  column_spec(2, bold = TRUE, color = "blue") %>%
  row_spec(1, background = "#f7f7f7")
```

This method will create a table that looks great in PDF output and provides a clean and organized presentation.

    mean_deaths = round(mean(total_decedents), 2),  # average death num each month, rounded to 2 decimal places
    median_deaths = round(median(total_decedents), 2),  # median, rounded
    min_deaths = min(total_decedents),  # minimum value
    max_deaths = max(total_decedents),  # maximum value
    male_ratio = round(sum(male) / total_deaths * 100, 2),  # ratio of male death, rounded

    other_ratio = round(sum(transgender_non_binary_two_spirit, na.rm = TRUE) / total_deaths * 100, 2)  # ratio of death of other genders, rounded
  )

  kbl(caption = "Annual Summary of Deaths in Toronto Shelters (2007-2023)", 
      col.names = c("Year", "Total Deaths", "Mean", "Median", "Min", "Max", "Male Ratio (%)", "Female Ratio (%)", "Other Ratio (%)")) %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = FALSE, html_font = "Cambria") %>%
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Deaths Summary" = 5, "Gender Ratios" = 3))
The table generated from the above is too wide and exceeds the page. How to make it smaller

ChatGPT

Generated by xinqiyue
To reduce the table size to avoid exceeding the page limits, you can use the `kable_styling` function with the `latex_options` parameter to set options like `scale_down`, and ensure that the font size of the table is appropriate. Additionally, you can set the column widths to make the table more compact. Here’s the modified code example:

```r
library(dplyr)
library(kableExtra)

summary_table <- shelter_death_data %>%
  filter(year >= 2007 & year <= 2023) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(
    total_deaths = sum(total_decedents),  # total death number
    mean_deaths = round(mean(total_decedents), 2),  # average death number each month, rounded to 2 decimal places
    median_deaths = round(median(total_decedents), 2),  # median, rounded
    min_deaths = min(total_decedents),  # minimum value
    max_deaths = max(total_decedents),  # maximum value
    male_ratio = round(sum(male) / total_deaths * 100, 2),  # ratio of male deaths, rounded
    female_ratio = round(sum(female) / total_deaths * 100, 2),  # ratio of female deaths, rounded
    other_ratio = round(sum(transgender_non_binary_two_spirit, na.rm = TRUE) / total_deaths * 100, 2)  # ratio of deaths of other genders, rounded
  )

summary_table %>%
  kbl(caption = "Annual Summary of Deaths in Toronto Shelters (2007-2023)",
      col.names = c("Year", "Total Deaths", "Mean", "Median", "Min", "Max", "Male Ratio (%)", "Female Ratio (%)", "Other Ratio (%)")) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "center", latex_options = "scale_down") %>%
  column_spec(1:9, border_right = TRUE) %>%
  add_header_above(c("Year" = 1, "Deaths Summary" = 5, "Gender Ratios" = 3)) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE)  # Make header bold for better visibility
```

### Explanation:
- **`latex_options = "scale_down"`**: This option will scale down the table to fit within the page size.
- **`column_spec(1:9, border_right = TRUE)`**: Adds a right border to all columns, which can be adjusted as needed.

After running this code, the table should shrink and fit within the PDF page. If it still exceeds the page limits, you might consider changing the font size or adjusting the column widths. You can further control the column widths using `column_spec` as necessary.
