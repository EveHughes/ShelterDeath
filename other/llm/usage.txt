# Read the analysis data of shelter residence death. shelter_death_data <- read_csv("../data/analysis_data/shelter_residences_death_analysis_data.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)   # get line graph, showing the annual death trend ggplot(shelter_death_data, aes(x = month, y = total_decedents, group = year)) +   geom_line(size = 1, color = "black") +  # get line graph   geom_point(size = 2, color = "pink") +  # add points on value in each year   labs(title = "Total Deaths in Toronto Shelters (2007-2024)",        x = "Month",        y = "Total Deaths") +  # as title and name of the axis   theme_minimal() +    theme(     plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, face = "bold"),     axis.title = element_text(size = 12)   ) +   facet_wrap(~ year, ncol = 3) the result graph is not in order from jan To dec, how to fix that

To ensure that the months are displayed in order from January to December in your `ggplot2` graph, you need to convert the `month` column into a factor with levels set to the correct order. Here’s how you can modify your code:

```r
# Read the analysis data of shelter residence death
shelter_death_data <- read_csv("../data/analysis_data/shelter_residences_death_analysis_data.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

# Convert the 'month' column to a factor with levels in the correct order
shelter_death_data$month <- factor(shelter_death_data$month, levels = month.abb)

# Get line graph showing the annual death trend
ggplot(shelter_death_data, aes(x = month, y = total_decedents, group = year)) + 
  geom_line(size = 1, color = "black") +  # Get line graph
  geom_point(size = 2, color = "pink") +  # Add points on value in each year
  labs(title = "Total Deaths in Toronto Shelters (2007-2024)",
       x = "Month",
       y = "Total Deaths") +  # Add title and name of the axis
  theme_minimal() +    
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 12)
  ) + 
  facet_wrap(~ year, ncol = 3)
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Convert the month to a factor**: The `month` column is converted to a factor with levels specified as `month.abb`, which contains the abbreviations for the months in the correct order (Jan, Feb, ..., Dec).
  
2. **Using `facet_wrap`**: This will now correctly display the months in the proper sequence for each year.

With these adjustments, your graph should now display the months in chronological order.

help cite https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/deaths-of-people-experiencing-homelessness/

ChatGPT

Generated by xinqiyue
To cite the dataset from the Toronto Open Data portal in BibTeX format, you can use the following entry:

```bibtex
@misc{toronto_homelessness_deaths,
  title = {Deaths of People Experiencing Homelessness},
  author = {{City of Toronto}},
  year = {2023},
  url = {https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/deaths-of-people-experiencing-homelessness/},
  note = {Accessed: 2024-09-24}
}
```

Make sure to adjust the `year` to reflect the latest update of the dataset if necessary. This citation includes the title, author (City of Toronto), year, URL, and a note indicating when you accessed the dataset.
